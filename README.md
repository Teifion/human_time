# HumanTime
Adapted from my [human_time library for Python](https://github.com/Teifion/human_time_py) but for Elixir.

The purpose of this library is to take written date/time such as "every other tuesday", "every weekday", "every friday at 2pm" etc, and convert it into a sequence of datetimes fitting the string.

## Installation
**Currently not in Hex**

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `human_time` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:human_time, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/human_time](https://hexdocs.pm/human_time).
